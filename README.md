# Data-Structure-using-C
* The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory. 
* Types of Data Structures
There are two types of data structures:
 1. Primitive data structure
 2. Non-primitive data structure
* Primitive Data structure
The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.

* Non-Primitive Data structure
The non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:

1. Linear data structure
2. Non-linear data structure

* Linear Data Structure:
1. Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
2.  Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.
* Non-Linear Data Structure
1. Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
2. Example: tree, graph, table, etc

## Why Learn C?

* It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
* If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
* C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
* C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies

## Requirements C

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4
* All your files should end with a new line
